### Pedals
#### Forte Pedals (Mid-Tier - Load Cell)
- **Price**: €449 (2-pedal) introductory, €499 permanent
  - 3-pedal with clutch: €698 (intro), €748 (permanent)
  - Clutch alone: €249 (permanent price reduction from €349)
  - "Well priced amongst the competition"
  - "At this price point I don't think there's much on the market that can compete"
  - "One of the best value for money sets on the market, if not the best"
- **Material**: Anodized aluminum, European-made (Denmark/Scandinavia)
- **Build Quality**: "Really nice, everything you'd expect from Scandinavian company"
  - "Immense craftsmanship"
  - "Attention to detail"
  - "Engineering precision"
- **Design**: "Quite neutral but also has character"
  - "Instantly recognizable"
  - "A bit retro for me" but easy to appreciate
- **Brake System**: Custom-designed load cell (not hydraulic like Invicta)
  - MLC PC technology (patent pending)
  - Single elastomer in chamber
  - Two spare elastomers of different strengths included
  - Elastomer physically limited in compression
  - Chamber sends 100% braking force to load cell once elastomer done
  - Similar to cup system in other pedals
  - Prevents excessive wear
  - Doesn't allow elastomer to get overly compressed
  - "Unleashed maximum from design with least moving parts"

**Forte vs Invicta Comparison:**
- "Identical to Invictas except custom load cell vs hydraulic pressure sensor"
- "Pretty much everything other than logo, pedal faces, and brake are identical"
- "Reassuringly familiar" feel
- "Although looks inferior on paper, actually very good"
- **Brake Feel**: "Actually gives me more definition through foot than Invictus"
  - "Many will even prefer it"
  - "Braking is such a subjective thing"
- **Philosophy Difference**:
  - Invicta: "Professional grade equipment, ideal training tool for real-life conditions"
  - Forte: "Ideal sim racing pedals"
  - Forte brake "slightly more granular and defined"
  - "Less like real race car but allows mental compensation for lack of G-forces"
  - "Additional static feel allows muscle memory training without strict leg training regime"
- **Analogy**: "Like buying 5 series BMW instead of 7 series"
  - "Just because 7 series exists doesn't mean 5 series is inferior"
  - "Just serves different market"
- **Upgrade Path**: Can upgrade Forte to Invicta THORP system in future
  - Only recommend if MLC PC not heavy enough
  - Don't expect upgrade to cost less than price difference between Forte and Invicta

**Forte Brake Performance:**
- "Slightly more granular and defined" than Invicta
- Good sense of progression despite single elastomer
- Ideal for sensitive brakes
- "Even better for trail braking or balancing car"
- May be quite heavy for first-time high-end load cell users
- NOT for those wanting road car feel
- Road car brakes "generally not efficient for track use"
- Road car brake habits "need to be unlearned"

**Forte Throttle:**
- "Very functional and quite good"
- "A little bit light for my preference"
- Would like slightly stiffer pedal
- Would love easy on-the-fly adjustment
- Hope Asetek addresses need for heavier throttle in future
- Pedal plate "a little bit short for heel-toe in default configuration"
- May be difficult for some to get clean purchase when blipping during braking
- Would love longer throttle pedal or better shape for heel-toe
- "Heel and toe is manageable" if brake sits proud of throttle

**Forte Clutch:**
- €249 permanent (reduced from €349)

- Worth spending time adjusting
- Don't forget vertical adjustment (biggest difference to simulated bite point)

**Forte Pedal Faces:**
- "Breath of fresh air"
- "Great with socks and even better with shoes"
- "Just enough grip and just enough slip"
- Different from Invicta faces (which were criticized)
- **User Note**: Smooth faces feel OK without shoes (unlike Invicta)

**Forte Base Plate:**
- "Clever design, well thought out for mounting and cable management"
- LED design "muted perfectly so not tacky"
- Can completely switch off LEDs
- "Really beautiful" - continues onto clutch base plate
- Pre-attached, cannot use pedals independently
- No means to change spacing or invert pedals
- Ridges and lettering quite grippy (easy to catch shoes)
- Dip where two plates meet = nice resting point for H-pattern (unintended benefit)
- Very strong but lighter than many competitors
- Ideal for motion systems (weight savings = performance increases)

**Forte Mounting:**
- 6 mounting points (3-pedal), 4 (2-pedal), 2 (clutch)
- Not based on existing industry standards (need to drill)
- Aluminum profile mounting relatively simple
- Rear throttle mounting hole slightly awkward but accessible
- Pre-assembled, simple installation (attach clutch, plug in, USB to PC)

**Forte Adjustability:**
- No lateral adjustment in pedal arms (fixed to base plate)

- Pedal arms have multiple mounting holes (some adjustment)
- "May be an issue for some people"

**Forte Software:**
- "Cracking job with this software"
- Calibration extremely important
- Recalibrate after every adjustment
- Can set curves for each individual pedal
- Manipulate sim input vs physical input
- Handy for sensitive cars
- Can sync clutch bite point with dead zone/plateau
- Reviewer sticks to linear for brake/throttle
- No interactive 3D model (unlike Invicta software)
  - "A little disappointed" - doesn't make faster but "gave sense of decadence"
  - "Feel Forte pedals also deserve" this feature
- Recommend removing initial 2% dead zone
  - If signal fluctuates, add some back
  - Pedals perform better with no software dead zone

**Forte Development:**
- Released "only a few short months" after Invicta flagship
- "Surprised by pace Asetek working"
- Momentum growing
- Working with Kevin Magnussen to develop products
- "How many other sim racing companies have top tier drivers involved?"
- Asetek "listened to customers" for clutch price reduction
- "Found a way to make it work" at reduced price

**Forte Overall Verdict:**
- "One of the best pedal sets I've ever used"
- "Definitely one of the best value for money sets on the market"
- "At this price point I don't think there's much on the market that can compete"
- "Amazing to see European-based company offer European designed and built solution at this price"
- "Expected many corners to be cut" but "nothing short of top tier"
- "Seriously good option"
- "Would probably never need to upgrade again"
- If have spare €700 and looking for pedals, "seriously good option"
- "Value for money is subjective" but this is exceptional

#### Original Invicta THORP 1 Pedals (First Generation - Historical)
- **Original Price**: €849 (2-pedal), €1,198 (3-pedal with clutch)
  - Clutch alone: €349 (includes own base plate)
  - Sock-friendly pedal faces: €59 extra
- **Material**: Anodized aluminum, European-made (Denmark)
- **Brake System**: THORP hydraulic technology (pioneering sealed hydraulic system)
  - Two-stage braking feel (pads to disc, then firm hydraulic wall)
  - Short throw with very firm press to 100%
  - First phase: 30 bar pressure (~30 kg/cm²) - quite heavy for first-time load cell users
  - Second phase: Minuscule movement, more force registers
  - Hydraulic fluid cannot be compressed (no force loss)
  - "Excellent pedal" - smooth, effective, quick and consistent
  - Suited reviewer's natural preference perfectly
- **Testing**: One million cycle testing framework, tested by real racers

**THORP 1 Characteristics:**
- **Philosophy**: "Made for simulation" - accurately simulate real pedal conditions
- **Target**: Ideal training tool for real race car drivers
- **Brake Travel**: Very short (too short for some)
  - Extended travel kit developed due to demand
  - Softens initial phase, lengthens throw
  - "Really like" extended travel kit
- **Force Requirements**: Need relatively high pressure to appreciate
  - Risk: First-time users may max calibration at end of first phase
  - May not appreciate value of second phase
  - If only using first phase, "not for you" - better solutions exist
- **Two-Phase System**: 
  - Phase 1: Initial braking, brings pads close to disc, has braking effect, for balancing/preparing
  - Phase 2: Pedal becomes very firm, brakes do primary job, almost no movement
  - Some argue only two phases "somewhat primitive" vs 3+ elastomer systems
  - Question: Would we design this way if real cars didn't exist?
- **Adjustability**: Almost 100% toolless (very welcome)
  - "Incredible" toolless adjustability
  - "Very satisfying to experiment"
  - Can adjust during pit stop
  - Does NOT offer large range vs competitors
  - Preferences may fall outside adjustment capabilities
- **Pedal Incline**: Default 90 degrees (recommend reducing unless horizontal rig)
  - Can cramp shins in longer stints
- **No Lateral Adjustment**: Pedals fixed to base plate
  - Cannot change spacing between pedals
  - Cannot invert pedals (despite THORP capable of upside-down use)
- **Mounting**: 
  - 6 mounting points (3-pedal), 4 (2-pedal), 2 (clutch)
  - Not based on existing industry standards (need to drill)
  - Aluminum profile mounting relatively simple
  - Rear throttle mounting hole slightly awkward
  - Requires solid base plate (extremely heavy brake pressurizes mounting)
  - NOT advised for rigs with flex, creaks, weak points, or seat movers
  - Will help find any flex/weak points in rig

**THORP 1 Issues & Criticisms:**
- **Pedal Faces**: "Biggest criticism"
  - Extremely aggressive raised diamond cut holes
  - Super grippy but uncomfortable without shoes
  - Chews through rubber soles significantly
  - Need to clean rubber pellets off rig after each session
  - "Practically unusable without shoes"
  - Heel and toe manageable but chews up racing shoes
  - Foot sticks to pedal and travels with it
  - Foot gets caught on heel rest when returning
  - "Extremely difficult to relearn technique" after 25 years
  - Really impacted driving
  - Owners 3D printing their own smooth faces
  - Sock-friendly faces should be free option at purchase (not €59 extra)
  - "Very wasteful" to buy separately
  - Removing pedal faces tough, "almost like never designed to be removed"
  - Very soft bolts - need extreme care with torque
  - Ensure allen key properly seated before applying force
- **Heel Plate**:
  - Ridges and lettering quite grippy
  - Shoes kept gripping when not driving
  - Dip where two plates meet = nice resting point for H-pattern (unintended benefit)
  - USB cable clip: Light plastic construction, many breakages reported
  - Asetek addressing issue, no functional impact currently
  - Two base plates joined together feels "a little bit brittle"
- **Throttle**: "Too light for my preference"
  - Better than many but lacks firmness
  - Asetek claimed "throttle is simple pedal, not worth over-engineering"
  - Reviewer: "Throttle control absolutely vital"
  - "Nothing makes throttle more controllable than nice and firm and predictable"
  - Would love adjustable weight setting
- **Clutch**: €349 seems high (includes own base plate though)
  - "Perfectly good clutch" - functional, very adjustable, decent weight
  - Good for H-pattern (rally, drift, circuit racing)
  - Never felt needed more, but "maybe not unreasonable to expect more" at price
  - Can run relatively heavy with spring preload adjustment
  - Factory setting not most realistic, worth spending time adjusting
- **Software**: 
  - Missing ability to save pedal/graph calibration configurations
  - Would love to switch between F1 car and road car configs
  - Community feedback requesting this feature
- **Styling**: "Retro styling nice but perhaps looks a little dated"
  - In lineup with competitors, "wouldn't be too enthused by looks"
  - Despite obvious attention to detail and craftsmanship
