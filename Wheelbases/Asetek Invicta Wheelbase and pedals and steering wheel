Asetek is the ultimate friend zone sim racing brand. Everyone talks about how lovely they are but meanwhile they are out partying with cheaper and better looking alternatives.


Asetek has solved a puzzle and I don't think everyone knows about it. From two stage braking systems to one handed Quick Releases. From true USB passthrough to replaceable wheel handles, Asetek has significantly changed sim racing over the past few years. So what happens when they combine absolutely everything into one package? We're about to find out. I'm Laurence, welcome to the channel. 

1. Introduction
On the left you’ll see all the sections in this video. I’ve put timestamped links to each section in the description below. 

Asetek Simsports is a Danish company which prides itself on innovation and design. Their incredible success in the liquid cooling space has helped them to perfect large scale production or mission critical hardware. With their passion for real world motorsports, they applied everything in their arsenal to create the products featured in this video.

While their latest Initium range currently has xbox compatibility, the products shown in this video are PC only. 

2. First Impressions
The looks of these products are not for everyone. That being said, I love the look of the invicta wheel and I like the wheelbase itself. The pedals are a little bit retro for my liking and although you don't see your pedals when you race, looks are still important to sim racers. For some, form is more important than function. 

Asetek's open eco-system approach and modular  design are hugely impressive. So much so that others in the industry have followed them on their path.

The power button and emergency stop look cool on the front mount. There's a bit of fiddling to the wheelbase installation as I'll explain in more detail in a later section.  

While 27Nm of torque and 100 bar of brake pressure sound like overkill, these figures are carefully selected to accurately simulate real world scenarios. 

3. Price
As this is the high end, we can expect high end pricing. Before taxes, the Invicta wheelbase comes in at €1,300, the Invicta Formula Button Box comes in at around €1350 incuding these handles, The pedals come in at €800 plus another €250 for the clutch. I've upgraded the pedal faces to the smooth Forte Pedal Face plates for another €40. I've also got the front mount which is €140. All together, that's around €3900 excluding taxes and shipping. That's a hefty price tag, but similar to the prices of most competitors in this bracket. 

They offer a third party quick release for €125 which allows for beautiful native style integration with almost all third party wheels. Some wheels can even route the cable internally for a truly seamless USB Passthrough experience. Asetek knows that you wont love every product in their range, so they want to make their eco-system as open as possible. 

4. Installation - Hardware
The pedals are a breeze to install. They come in a moderately stiff brake pedal configuration which will suit most people. 4 bolts secure the base plate to most rigs, and should you want the clutch as I do, it's just an extra couple of bolts. 

The wheelbase easily base mounts, but you'll need to find somewhere to mount the power button and emergency stop button. Unfortunately you cannot run the base without them. 

With the front mount, the buttons have a clear home although it's still a little DIY to install them. Thankfully the front mount fits all rigs with aluminium profile uprights so installing it is a one and done operation with plenty of adjustment available. I'l like some measurements at either side to help to ensure that the wheelbase is perfectly centered though. 

To install the front mount, you also need to remove the plastic cover on the front of the wheelbase. Then you need to release the slip ring and effectively guess the amount that you need to move it so that the plastic cover will look nice and flush agai. My point being, this is fiddly and a little DIY which I'm not a huge fan of when spending this much money. 

Installing the wheel is glorious though. While maybe not as rewarding as an NRG quick release, this wedge QR which Asetek purchased rights for from Simucube SC2 works great with the little handle which doesn't get in the way of your driving experience at all. This is the only QR system in sim racing which allows one handed operation and it is arguable they quickest of the lot. 

5. Installation - Software
Software is important for high end hardware products. Asetek has really done a good job with their software and their external simub integration. They even allow a super slick combination of canned effects from RaceHub with dashes from Simhub. Their own dashes are decent, but SimHub is king for DDU units and screens on wheels in my opinion. 

For force feedback, Asetek's default game profiles have gone from strength to strength over the years thanks to a vibrant and capable community. I barely adjust anything in the force feedback software these days. If the defaults aren't to your liking, hop into their discord because there are so many great options in there too. 

 Finally for braking, the ability to set braking curves is almost  taken for granted these days. Although truth be told, I always leave it in linear mode. 

The sofware allows for lots of LED configuration too. I actually LIKE the LEDs but they're not to everyone's taste. You can turn them off, but I also understand that people feel like they're paying for a flashy feature that they don't really want. LEDs are configurable to in game telemetry but I usually leave them quite static, other than flag notifications during races. Lighting options are limited though and I'd love if all LEDs could be controlled through a simhub plugin.

For EA WRC and Dirt Rally 2.0, I've had to manually edit configuration files to get the invicta to be recognised. Again, the Asetek discord is really helpful but I'd prefer not to have to do this every couple of months.  

On a final note for software, my force feedback profile keeps reverting back to the F1 profile regularly so i always have to second guess whether the right profile is loaded. Despite complete wipes of my system, renaming configuration folders and other attempts, this keeps happening to me, but doesn't happen to anyone I've asked.  

6. Invicta Pedals
These pedals are amongst my top 5 pedals recommendations purely because they've nailed the feeling with the new THORP 2 system. You can run these relatively soft, but they really shine when you set them slightly stiffer. The ability to feel that 2 stage braking is like a cheat code. When tuned correctly, you can consistenly hit 80% which is where you want to be to avoid ABS activation in the likes of iRacing.

While these pedals function impeccably, they're not perfect. Those face plates are rough. They'll eat your feet and they'll cause excessive wear on shoes. Ask me how I know... I opted for the Forte smooth face plates which feel like an upgrade.  

The throttle could be heavier but the throw is easily adjusted. The brake sensor is super sensitive but easy to modulate. The clutch is decent. It matches the 2 pedal set very well and functions well. There's a clear bite point and a considerable amount of adjustment to preload, throw and bite point can be achieved. 

7. Invicta Steering Wheel
When someone shows someone their rig, they point at the steering wheel. In my opinion, Asetek has created one of the finest steering wheels in sim racing here. The finish is superb. The materials are second to none. The weight is incredibly light for what it is.

They've got a well integrated 4.3" screen which jumps to life when it illuminates. It looks like this wheel was build around the screen, rather than most wheels which look like the screen was retro-fitted to an existing rim. 

While the screen is touch screen compatible, it currently doesn't support simhub functions in the same way as a typical vocore screen. For example, on lovelydash, if you wish to change a part of the dash to show something specific, you'll need to map that functionality in simhub rather than simply touching the screen. I hope that some day they fix this as it's a little annoying. 

Ergonomically, the wheel is phenomenal. With shifters and paddles and rotaries galore, you're set up for all eventualities. The scroll rotaries especially are so handy in titles like Le Mans Ultimate when driving a GTP car.

With replaceable handles you can make this  wheel exactly how you want it. Those handles completely change the look of this wheel.

9. Invicta Wheelbase Force Feedback
Cutting to the chase, this is amongst the best force feedback in sim racing. In a blind test, there's simply no way I'd be able to  tell the difference between this and any other high end wheelbases. 

I've used this base extensively for months in Assetto Corsa, ACC, iRacing, Le Mans Ultimate , Dirt Rally 2.0 and EA WRC. It's worth spending time with settings if it doesn't feel perfect for you, because trust me, you can get it to feel exceptionally good. 

There's plenty of power on tap meaning the force feedback is crisp and detailed. You won't believe how much you can feel while you understeer over a kerb, while rubbing doors with another car. You also wont run this at 100%, but don't worry about that. The power is useful for micro rotations of the wheel to relay detail. It's not made to break your wrists or tear your biceps.  

10. Final thought
I debated whether to review the wheelbase and pedals and wheel separately, but I felt like it was good to show the consistency across the products. While none of them are perfect in their own right, all 3 combine to make one of the best packages money can buy in sim racing. 

For me personally, the pedals are just a bit too retro styled for my preferences. But don't let that overshadow the incredible performance. I was instantly on pace and months later I found it difficult to adjust to other pedals unless they were very good.
