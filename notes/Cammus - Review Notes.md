- Packing foam
- Everything well branded
- "Gone to quite a lot of detail" with branding
- USB cable has Cammus branding
- Even bags are branded
- "Especially at this price point it's kind of interesting"

**Build Quality First Impressions:**
- "Lovely quality to it"
- "Quite nice"
- "Makes a good impression"
- "Very few imperfections"
- Only tiny bits of staining/marking (cosmetic only)
- "At this price point you would accept a lot of imperfection"
- Substantial weight (heavier than typical wheel rim)
- No flex whatsoever - "absolutely solid"

### Physical Design

**Weight:**
- "Obviously a lot heavier than most wheelbases" (motor included)
- "Lot of weight in that"
- "Usually when I hold steering wheel up to camera it's not as heavy"
- Reviewer wanted to weigh it but didn't show measurement
- Front plate has "bit of weight" - concerned about motor speed

**Buttons & Controls:**
- **20 buttons total** - "Acres of buttons, just buttons everywhere"
- **3 rotary encoders** - "Pretty good, better than a lot of high-end rotaries"
  - "Not exceptional, they're plasticky"
  - "Click is super super clear"
  - "Can't get much clearer than that"
- **2 shifter paddles** - "Tiny little flappy paddles"
  - "Very close to the steering wheel"
  - "Itty bitty, very very small"
  - "I would mod the flappy paddles, that's the first thing I would do"
  - "Would try and get 3D printed flappy paddles that were just a little bit further away"
  - Reason for size: base takes up space where paddles would normally go
  - **In practice**: "Not as annoying as I thought they would be"
  - "I'm not really even noticing that the shifters are so itty bitty"
  - Not very clicky, not very loud
- **Rev indicator**: LED strip, turns 180°
  - Shows on power up

- "Mount is really good"
- Compatible with standard wheel deck mounting
- ASR rig made swapping easy

### Assembly & Installation

**Table Clamp:**
- "Pretty simple, nothing too unusual"
- Requires complete assembly from scratch
- Multiple brackets and bolts
- Grippy/sticky pads included

- "Usually these brackets come largely assembled"
- Branded bags for hardware
- Don't have to mess with washers

**Cooling Fan:**
- Small turbo-style fan included
- Bolts provided seemed wrong length
- "Seems like a bit of an afterthought or maybe a design flaw"
- "Should probably just run it without it until I need it"
- Reviewer puzzled by installation

**Installation Time:**
- Full assembly required
- Not difficult but time-consuming
- All hardware provided

### Software Experience

**Download:**
- From Cammus website → Support → Downloads → C5 → Software

- Button recognition works perfectly
- All inputs recognized correctly

**First Run:**
- Center seems set quite well
- Everything recognized immediately
- No major setup issues

### Force Feedback Performance

**Initial Impressions (Default Settings):**
- "Very very little force happening right now"
- "Quite natural the way it's going back to start"
- "Not wobbling, little bit of wobble there but that's quite normal"
- Set to 100% in-game initially - still quite low
- "I have a very good frame of reference" (coming from 21 Nm wheelbase)

**After Tuning:**
- Power cranked to 100%
- Damping adjusted (started at 50)
- Friction at 50
- Let game handle settings initially
- Turned everything down in-game first

**Mechanical Characteristics:**
- "Quite a bit of almost vibration through the steering wheel"
- "Not necessarily in a good way" initially
- "Less now, maybe it's a high speed thing"
- "Probably going to be easy to dial out with a bit of damping"
- "Little bit of mechanical noise"
- "I'm sure I can get out with damping"
- After damping adjustment: "I thought that might just be a loose bolt or something, it's not"
- "Everything is absolutely solid"

**Detail & Feel:**
- "This is really good guys"
- "Absolutely nothing telling me this is an entry-level device"
- "I know it's 5 Newton meter"
- Going over curbs: "Quite good"
- Grass feel: "Feels great"
- Understeer: "Feels great, very good"
- "Would be nice to get a bit more of a kick off the curbs" (power limitation)
- "I took off a 21 Newton meter wheelbase to go to this and I thought it would be a world of a difference"
- "This is so pleasant"

**Centering & Snap:**
- "Centering is like the way it corrects the steer"
- "Way the steering wheel snaps is really good"
- "Speed that the steering wheel snaps at is actually that was a concern of mine"
- "I thought it might just be a little bit slow"
- "You can see with the snapping over center that is a very normal thing in sims"
- "Can see how quickly that's moving - that is quick"
- **Responsiveness**: "So good, response is so good"
- "It even moves too quickly" (in drift testing)

**Comparison Statements:**
- "I wasn't expecting it to be a really good force feedback experience"
- "This sets the bar very high"
- "Out of the box I would say it's a better force feedback experience than Moza"
- "They've got good force feedback, it's not as natural as this"
- "This is very very natural"
- "More premium than using a CSL DD with the rally rim, the WRC rim"
- "Definitely feels there's no flex whatsoever"

### Settings Adjustments

**In-Game (Assetto Corsa):**
- Started at 100% - too low
- Adjusted force feedback strength

### Racing Performance

**Circuit Racing (Assetto Corsa):**
- Tested with difficult car (lots of power, squirmy)
- "If any of you have ever driven this car you know why it's a bit of a crazy car"
- "That is excellent, that is absolutely excellent"
- Counter steering very intuitive
- Understeer and oversteer communicated well
- Loading up through corners felt clearly
- Curb detail good
- "Very comfortable to drive it guys, very comfortable"

**With Round Rim:**
- "I much prefer this with the round rim"
- More comfortable
- Better for catching slides
- "It was very intuitive with the round rim"
- Easier to control

**With Formula Rim:**
- "Does definitely feel a little bit better for formula use"
- "Didn't find it as easy to catch that slide there"
- "Maybe that's because I've just been using a round rim on the C5 for the last while"
- "Feeling lots of force, I don't know why I'm feeling more force through it"
- "Only slightly smaller"
- "Straight edges on it so that makes a little bit of a difference"
- "You have a bit more space I think to touch the thumb rotaries"
- "It is nice, I mean if you drive mainly GT and stuff and you'd have no need for a round rim, at least there's an option"
- "Really good kind of universal button plate"
- "You're never going to get that true formula style experience" with this button plate
- Reviewer's gut: "This rim mod I don't know, I don't think it's for me"
- "But it is cool that it's there"

**High Force Testing:**
- "The power, uh, that was pretty violent, pretty aggressive"
- "I have it on a very high setting here"
- "You probably wouldn't run it on this setting if you're prone to spinning out"
- "You would really want to be confident that you're going to keep it on the track"
- "As you saw there it's very very hard to hold on to it as it would be in a real car"
- "Sometimes in the simulator you can catch slides and stuff or withstand forces that in real life you couldn't"
- "In real life it could break your wrists"
