# Heusinkveld Review Notes

## V1 Sequential Shifter (5 Years Old - Historical Reference)

### First Impressions
- **Size & Weight**: Surprisingly small and heavy unit
- **Packaging**: Not as fancy as their pedals, but hardware is confident and well thought-out
- **Build Quality**: Thick metal sheet plates fit together with beautiful precision
- Small circuit board with clever hinging mechanism
- Perspex window makes electronics partly visible (prevents short circuit with metal casing)

### What's Included
- Great variety of shift knobs
- Different rods for various angles and applications
- Table clamp included
- Various mounting options
- Mounting bracket provides snug fit on rig shifter plates

### Build & Design
- Compact form factor
- Heavy throw despite small size
- Metal construction with precision fit
- USB port on back sticks out quite a bit (difficult to hide cable on small unit)
- Bits can fall off if you undo the side bolt - easy to reassemble once you understand operation
- Unbranded and somewhat mysterious appearance
- Premium finish with beautiful surfaces

### Feel & Performance
- **Throw Weight**: Surprisingly heavy throw (unexpected from such a small unit)
- **Engagement**: Great mechanical clunk when shifting into gear
- **Resistance**: Consistent mechanical resistance that feels natural

- **Assembly**: Comes pre-assembled in vertical orientation (most common configuration)
- **Weight**: Serious weight to the unit, feels premium
- **Handle Preference**: Reviewer preferred V1 handle shape over V2
- **Color Options**: Would like to see black version available
- **Quote on Box**: "When in doubt, flat out" (Colin McRae rally reference)
- **Bonus Item**: Embroidered Heusinkveld hat included (may not be standard with all purchases)
- **Build Quality**: Laser cut steel, stiff lightweight construction, glass bead blasted powder coating
- **Visual Appeal**: Beautiful finish, looks very nice

### Price & Value
- **MSRP**: €300 / $300
- Regarded as high-end handbrake
- Includes two extra elastomers and several spacers
- Price justified by quality and customer service reputation
- Heusinkveld customer service stories are "amazing"

### What's Included
- Pre-assembled handbrake unit
- Product manual (nicely printed, not just PDF)
- Heusinkveld stickers
- Mounting base plate with wings (somewhat hidden in packaging)
- **Elastomers**: 
  - Pre-installed elastomer
  - HC Hard 19mm elastomer
  - HE 28mm elastomer
  - Additional elastomers (clearly labeled with numbers, not just colors)
- Seven hard plastic spacers (various sizes for configuration)
- USB cable (plain USB, no adapters needed)
- Tiny spanner/wrench (made from same metal)
- T-slot nuts
- Metal washers
- Various mounting hardware
- **Note**: Lots of adjustability out of box without needing upgrade kit

### Installation & Mounting
- **Difficulty**: Mounting handbrakes is "never fun" - complete minefield
- **Base Plate**: Included but easy to miss in packaging (should be more visible)
- **Winged Mounting Plate**: Good for mounting to profile rig uprights
- **Bolt Tolerance**: Minimal tolerance on four bolt holes makes installation tricky
- **Bolt Size**: Mounting bolts are tiny
- **Mounting Options**: Base plate allows for angled installation (common for horizontal mounting)
- **Cable Management**: USB port positioned well to keep cable out of sight
- **Positioning Challenges**: Everyone wants different positions (between wheel/shifter, opposite side, high, low, etc.)
- **Reviewer's Preference**: Wants handbrake mounted halfway between upright and steering wheel, up high
- **Mounting Solution Needed**: Would like mounting plate that accommodates both shifter and handbrake
- **Profile Rig Mounting**: May need to mount piece of profile or use 90-degree brackets
- **Corner Bracket Issue**: Can touch leg slightly depending on position
- **Height**: Reviewer would prefer handbrake mounted higher than tested position
- **Proximity to Wheel**: Can be mounted too close to steering wheel (hand collision)

### Software - Smart Control
- **Plug and Play**: No calibration needed initially, just works
- **Calibration**: Intuitive and very visual calibration wizard
- **Curves**: Can set curves to impact handbrake behavior
- **Profiles**: Save and share multiple profiles easily
- **Max Force Adjustment**: Easy to adjust without recalibrating

- Takes headache out of setup compared to lesser-known brands

### Feel & Performance
#### Positives
- Very good handbrake overall
- Incredible build quality
- Forces can satisfy even heavy-handed users
- Excellent kit aside from specific criticisms
- 120kg load cell is super sensitive (possibly 200kg - very capable)
- **Mechanism**: Very heavy and robust
- **Operation**: Pulls toward you, pulling down elastomer
- **Dead Stop**: Hard mechanical limitation (not elastomer) - bolt hitting rounded part
- **Pivot Point**: Not adjustable
- **Handle Height**: Adjustable in height
- **Default Feel**: Relatively light to lock (not necessarily bad)
- **Can Handle Force**: Can pull very hard on it
- **Real-Life Comparison**: Doesn't feel too dissimilar to some real drift cars
- **Performing Well**: Works quite well in testing
- **Drifting Performance**: Allows proper rotation and wall proximity
- **Rally Performance**: Reliable for rally stages

#### Criticisms
- **Handle Shape**: Very hard and odd shape, doesn't fit hand well
- **Grip Issues**: No finger recesses or imprints, force concentrates on small part of fingers
- **Handle Holes**: Look great but serve no real purpose (can get fingers stuck)
- **Travel Path**: J-shaped movement (handle travels downward when pulled)
- **Fulcrum Position**: Feels like it's in wrong place
- **Elastomer Loading**: Pull movement rather than push movement
- **Not Realistic**: Movement unlike any real-life vertical handbrake reviewer has used
- **Handle Design**: Can't imagine this exact handle in real drift/rally car
- **Bump Stop**: Hits hard metal stop under enthusiastic use in most configurations (feels odd)
- **Progression**: Not huge amount of force progression before hitting bump stop

#### Default Configuration Feel
- Little bit of "dead zone" at start (does register in sim)
- Last little bit of pull at end provides final engagement
- Simulates real hydraulic handbrake that needs a bleed
- More than usable out of box

### Adjustments & Configuration
#### Default Setup
- Fitted with spring and soft 28mm elastomer
- Spring found to be too soft by reviewer
- Good enough for most casual users

#### Preload Adjustment
- Tool-free preload adjustment
- Reviewer tightened preload within few hours for more instant bite
- Personal preference for less movement before effect

#### Elastomer Kit (Included)
- **Pre-installed**: 1x soft 28mm elastomer
- **Upgrade Kit**: 1x hard 28mm elastomer, 1x hard 19mm elastomer
- **Total Options**: Three elastomers to choose from
- **Reviewer's Setup**: Hard 28mm + hard 19mm elastomers (reasonable progression with instant bite)

#### Additional Adjustments
- Seven hard plastic spacers to separate elastomers/spring or replace elastomer
- **Toolless Adjustment**: Preload adjustable without tools
- **Handle Angle**: Adjustable independently of handbrake (useful for non-horizontal/non-vertical mounting)
- Most users won't need angle adjustment
- Lots of adjustment points to change angle
- Can make it stiffer easily with included elastomers

### Use Cases
- Rally (competitive events)
- Drifting (casual and competitive)
- **Primary Purpose**: Lock rear wheels to introduce rotation
- **Secondary Purpose**: Introduce wash to trajectory (widen slide circumference)
- **Tertiary Purpose**: Independently control rear wheel speed without slowing fronts

### Handbrake Philosophy
- "Do I need a handbrake?" - If you don't know, then you don't
- Essential for rally and drifting
- Limited scope of what they need to achieve

### Comparison Notes
- V1 handbrake didn't have same handle/travel issues
- Reviewer spent less time with V1 than V2

### Final Verdict (V2 Handbrake)
- Very good handbrake despite criticisms
- High quality and functional (typical Heusinkveld)
- Handle movement and grip shape are biggest weaknesses
- Lots of adjustment options (soft to super hard)
- Mounting no more difficult than other handbrakes (but not Heusinkveld-specific problem)
- Not reviewer's favorite sim handbrake, but still very good product
- Recommend watching multiple reviews before deciding
- Renowned customer satisfaction and support
- **First Impressions**: Very very good, very usable
- **Premium Feel**: Really nice, well thought-out product
- **Quality**: Can't doubt the quality, no complaints
- **Safe Bet**: Heusinkveld already has reputation, safe purchase
- **Comparison**: Very similar to what felt at expo, but on own setup
- **Default Setup**: More than usable even if couldn't adjust further
- **Established Brand**: Can take many things for granted (reliability, support)
- **Customer Service**: Offers support even for second-hand purchases or modified units
- **Pedigree**: Supplies to Williams Esports, Team Redline, Mercedes AMG
- **Real-World Comparison**: Feels like real hydraulic handbrake needing bleed

### Review Context
- Product sent free for review purposes (first Heusinkveld long-term review)
- Used for couple of months in competitive rally and casual drifting
- Reviewer has real-life handbrake experience (influenced opinions)
- Review uninfluenced by other reviews (watched none beforehand)
- Reviewer never reviewed V1 handbrake (used it but no formal review)
- **First Impressions Video**: Unboxing and immediate rig testing
- **Testing Track**: Chose track with specific clipping points requiring handbrake
- **Testing Discipline**: Drifting (Nissan S13/Laurel) with exaggerated handbrake use
