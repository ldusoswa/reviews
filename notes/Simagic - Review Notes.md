## Alpha Evo Lineup Overview

### Product Line Structure
- **Alpha Evo Sport**: 9 Nm entry level
- **Alpha Evo** (unnamed): 12 Nm mid-tier
- **Alpha Evo Pro**: 18 Nm flagship
- **Naming Confusion**: "Naming is a little bit confusing"
  - No longer called Mini/Ultimate
  - Middle tier has no name (just "12 Newton meter")
  - "Very nice to be able to identify them by name very easily"
  - Gets complicated when people ask "Alpha U or Alpha Mini?"
  - "Sim Magic needs to really kind of stick with this branding"

### Key Innovations
- **No Cogging**: Major marketing point (though reviewer questions necessity)
  - "Never really subscribed to much" - didn't feel cogging on older Alphas
  - "Not an issue. It never has been an issue"
  - "Big selling point, I don't know"
- **USB Pass-Through**: Through shaft (power and data)
  - "Very very interesting"
  - Only works with upcoming Zeus range wheels
  - Current wheels (GT Neo, Neo X) still need Mag Link for SimHub
- **Power Pass-Through**: Through shaft
- **Connectivity**: "Lots and lots and lots of ports" on back
  - 8 Ethernet-style ports for future devices (not for existing CAN bus devices)
  - USB connections for CAN bus (old devices)

### Philosophy & Market Position
- **Open Ecosystem**: "Completely love about Sim Magic at the moment"
  - "Very open to other brands"
  - Traditionally "not been associated with sim racing brands"
  - Large companies "love to trap people in their ecosystem"
  - "Antiattern of business" traditionally
  - "Now it's something that's, you know, ASICH has been a pioneer in this area"
- **Ascher Pioneer**: "Shows that it really works for them"
  - "Pick and choose parts of your ecosystem"
  - "Loyal to your ecosystem, but not exclusively tied in"
- **Fanatec Problem**: "People get tied in and they get so upset with being tied in"
  - "Tend to want to just go out completely"
  - "Now that you can still USB connect individual Fanitech items and all that"
  - "Traditionally the ecosystem has been their strong selling point"

### Issues (Pre-Production)
- **Power Delivery**: "Having power issues with that"
  - Screen comes on but not enough power
  - "Not enough power being delivered to that"
  - "Screen is coming on, but there's no power"
- **Known Issue**: "Known issue with the pre-production version"
  - "They told me that this is a known issue"
- **Confidence**: "Confidence in that QA is relatively low"
  - "Haven't tested a lot of the older ones"
  - "I've got some other Semagic rims here"

### Mag Link Requirement
- **Still Needed**: For SimHub compatibility with GT Neo/Neo X
  - "That is definitely a big negative"
  - Expected wouldn't need Mag Link with new bases
  - "Thought the mag link was just a stop gap for the older bases"
  - "Really quite just a little disappointed by that"
  - "Here I am with this amazing base, this sensational steering wheel, and I can't get the full experience from it without that cable"
  - "That's a real pity. I'm really quite just a little disappointed by that"
- **Zeus Range**: Upcoming wheels don't need Mag Link cable
  - "Upcoming Zeus range, they don't need the Mag Link cable"
- **Current Experience**: SimHub not finding devices at all
  - Tested with GT Neo and Neo X
  - "Searching device. It's not finding it"
  - "Brightness must be set to 100% in SIM Pro and the wheel must be connected through USB"
  - Not happening with current setup
- **Mag Link Mod**: "Someone told me" there's a mod to allow existing wheels to run Mag Link
  - "My experience here with two of the Evo wheelbases is that SIMHub does not find the devices at all"

## Alpha Evo Sport (9 Nm)

### Force Feedback Performance
- **Power**: Lacks sufficient power for formula cars
  - "I'm lacking power here, guys"
  - At 100% in-game and 9 Nm: feels like ~4 Nm
  - Alpha Mini (10 Nm) felt like 11+ Nm - much more powerful
- **Detail Quality**: "Force feedback quality itself is phenomenal"
  - Details are spot on, excellent communication
  - Just needs more range/power
- **Better in iRacing**: Felt more powerful than in Assetto Corsa
- **Vibration**: Lots of vibration noise through rig
- **Mechanical Friction**: Helped make it feel more powerful
  - Don't normally like it but necessary here

### Comparison to Alpha Mini
- Alpha Mini was 10 Nm (actually 11+ Nm peak) - plenty of power
- Sport is 9 Nm - "definitely feels like 9 Newton meters peak"
- Many said reviewer got early Alpha Mini closer to 12 Nm Evo

### Final Verdict (Sport)
- **Not Recommended**: Unlike Alpha Mini recommendation
  - "Would not be recommending the Sport to people where I would have recommended the Alpha Mini highly in the past"
- **Go for Pro or 12 Nm**: "I would go for that Pro"
  - "The 12 Newton meter is going to be enough for most people"
- **Good for Beginners**: Will be plenty for beginner to intermediate
  - But will want more power eventually
- **Detail Quality**: Excellent, just lacks power range

---

## Alpha Evo Pro (18 Nm)

### Power Testing
- **At 9 Nm**: Feels same as Sport at 9 Nm (relatively light)
  - Two finger test: can push through corner with minimal force
  - "I don't think this is 9 Newton meters"
- **At 15 Nm**: "Much more along the lines of what I expect"
  - Still feels like 11-12 Nm (not scientific)
  - "Force feedback quality exceptional here. It's very, very good"
- **At 18 Nm**: Still not overwhelming
  - Feels like 14-15 Nm compared to other bases
  - "More than enough" for most people
  - "Abso fuckingutely, for sure"

### Force Feedback Quality
- **Exceptional**: "Top quality force feedback, guys. Make no mistake"
- **Very Direct**: "Feels very connected to the car, to the front axle"
- **Natural Grip Feel**: Can feel tire grip perfectly
- **Wheel Movement**: Reacts beautifully to road undulations
- **Detail Range**: "Beautiful range of detail"
- **Sliders**: "Seem very intuitive and simple"

### Noise Characteristics
- **Constant Noise**: "Bass does make quite a bit of noise"
- **Vibration**: "Sending a huge amount of vibration through my rig"
  - Short sharp high frequency jolts
  - "Whole rig is shaking"
  - Like a bass shaker
- **High Pitched Whine**: When going slowly, gets lower with speed
- **Comparison**: Similar to why turned off Logitech True Force

### Torque Measurement Discussion
- **"Max Torque"**: Not peak or holding - different measurement
  - Numbers seem higher than actual output
  - Similar to Moza advertising pattern
- **Comparisons**:
  - Asetek La Prima 12 Nm: would rip arms off
  - Logitech Pro 11 Nm: very powerful
  - Moza R12: nowhere near as powerful as those two
  - CSL DD with power adapter: Sport feels similar or less

### Settings Adjustments
- Reduced mechanical damper
- Increased wheel rotation speed to 100 (then back to ~60)
- Reduced feedback detail (contributes to vibration)
- Sliders very intuitive

### Final Verdict (Pro)
- **Phenomenal**: "Force feedback experience is really nice"
- **Recommended**: "I would go for that Pro"
  - "Can't wait to put that Pro on the rig"
- **Sufficient Power**: At 15-18 Nm, more than enough
- **Excellent Quality**: "Really is an excellent piece of kit"

## Force Feedback Deep Dive

### Unique Characteristics
- **Micro Vibrations**: "Feel micro vibrations, if that makes sense"
  - Extra little level of detail
  - Doesn't feel canned
  - Comes from simulator
  - "Cream on the top" that previous Alphas were missing
- **True Force Similarity**: "Similar to true force on like 10%"
  - Surprised Simagic didn't lead with this marketing
  - Instead focused on cogging (which reviewer doesn't care about)
- **Distinctive in Blind Test**: Would be able to tell it apart
  - Including from Simucube
  - Unique frequency vibration characteristics
  - "Rattling and vibration... can feel that"

### Detail Quality
- **Excellent**: Curb detail, road feel, communication
- **Road Detail**: Not massive amount
- **Curb Detail**: Excellent
- **Crests & Compressions**: Feels perfectly
- **Suspension**: Curbing feeling excellent
- **Understeer**: Nice and communicative

### Comparison to Previous Alphas
- **Better Force Feedback**: "Might be just slightly crisper"
  - Extra layer of detail
  - Puts it right up there with elite
- **Power Difference**: Alphas had more actual power
  - "Something about the power of the Alphas"
  - "My gut is saying the Alphas still have slightly better power"
- **Would Tell Apart**: In blind test due to vibration characteristics

### Top Tier Assessment
- **Elite Company**: Asetek, Logitech, Simucube, Sim Magic, VRS
- **Fanatec**: Never experienced this kind of force feedback
- **Trustmaster**: Never experienced it
- **Cammus**: Good with C5 and C12

## Long-Term Support Concerns

### Major Worry
- **Software Support**: "My one worry would be that Semagic for some reason stops supporting the software"
  - Similar to Simagic M10
  - "It is a concern"
- **Selling Side by Side**: Alpha and Evo ranges currently
  - "Would be very disingenuous to tempt people with a low price"
  - "Then next year pull the rug from under them"

### What Would Help
- **Promise from Simagic**: Support until 2030
  - "Would gain so much trust and market share"
  - "Secondhand market would thrive"
  - "EVOs would sell like hot cakes"
  - "Simagic is such a good company"
