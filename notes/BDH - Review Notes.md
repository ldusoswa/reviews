## Unboxing & First Impressions (Second Video)

### Packaging & Presentation
- **Outer Box**: Functional brown box with courier documents (not fancy)
- **Inner Case**: Arrives in a briefcase/suitcase with keys - very premium presentation
  - "Product with fanfare" - feels special
  - Keys included for briefcase
- **Contents**:
  - BDH stickers (large and small)
  - Mounting bolts (standard, straightforward)
  - Washers and T-slot nuts included
  - Silica gel packets
  - BDH branded cup (special touch - "will be seen on stream")
  - Gear stick shaft separate
  - USB cable exits from side
- **Foam**: Cut and hacked together pieces (not one solid piece)
  - Would like to see tidier foam for €1,400-1,500 product
  - Costs more but justified at this price point
  - Will update in comments if improved

### Visual Impressions
- **Machining**: Gorgeous, nicely machined
- **Appearance**: "Looks like a car part" - very cool
- **Finish**: Brushed aluminum (not perfect mirror chrome)
  - Chrome/silver might be too much for some
  - Questions about how it reacts to fingerprints over time
- **Logo**: BDH Race Sim Hardware sticker on side
  - Would love to see laser engraved instead
  - Logo is nice and deserves to be there
- **Shift Knob**: Black knob (with tape on finger during unboxing)
  - Prefer black knob over white
- **Weight**: Massive weight to it
- **Visual Impact**: "Visually impressive" - "striking visual piece"
- **Statement Piece**: Looks stunning on rig

### Bench Testing
- **Neutral Position**: Easy to find
- **Pin Movement**: Can see pin moving inside when shifting
- **Clamp**: Slight gaps where top clamp keeps unit together
- **Resistance Adjustment**: Large bolt on top (assumed for throw resistance)
- **First Gear**: Can really feel stuff engaging

### Installation Notes
- **Included Hardware**: T-slot nuts, washers, bolts
- **Rod Extensions**: Included for raising/lowering shift knob height
- **Mounting Position**: Initially temporary mount
  - A bit close to handbrake but manageable
  - Enough clearance in 3rd and 5th gear
  - Would prefer shifter closer and back a bit if no handbrake
  - "Every car is different anyway" - not critical
- **Side Mounting**: Cannot side mount (would be nice to mount low on rig)
- **Shifter Height**: Relatively high
- **Different Shaft Lengths**: Available to raise/lower gear stick
- **USB Cable**: On outside, roughly mounted initially (will be tidied)
- **Left-Hand Drive Setup**: Reviewer uses left-hand (Japanese/British cars, Ireland)
  - Most will mount right-hand side

### First Drive Experience
- **Test Car**: Lotus Seven with H-pattern (crazy fun car, lots of diff lock)
- **Expectations**: Very high - over a year of anticipation
  - "Nervous" about whether it would meet expectations
  - "I hope it doesn't let me down"
- **Shift Feel**: 
  - Very very short shift - "lovely short shift"
  - First gear feels slightly heavier than rest (nice, realistic)
  - "Very very nice and short"
  - Nicely dampened
  - Very predictable
- **Engagement**: "Feel like I am actually engaging a gear"
- **Real-World Comparison**: 
  - "Feels like a real shifter"
  - "If I sat into a real life car... I would say that is a lovely satisfying throw"
- **Learning Curve**: 
  - Initially put into reverse instead of 5th (no reverse lockout)
  - Put into 1st instead of 3rd once (user error)
  - Second to third became natural very quickly
- **Gear Configuration**: 5-speed plus reverse (not 6-speed)
  - Might be deal breaker for some people

### Noise Level (Revised Opinion)
- **Expectation vs Reality**: Much quieter than expected
  - Expected "really satisfying clock"
  - Actually nicely dampened
- **Comparison**: Much quieter than sequential shifters (massive bang)
- **Living Space**: Can use in common room without annoying wife
  - Not dedicated studio, just room in house
  - People in other rooms will hear it but won't be as annoyed
- **Verdict**: "Not too loud" - "it's not silent" but acceptable

### Performance Notes
- **Precision**: "So precise" - "precision engineering"
- **Satisfaction**: "So satisfying" - "feels amazing"
- **Out of Box**: Used without any adjustment
  - "That's how manufacturer wants you to experience it"
  - Can adjust heavier or softer later
- **Heel-Toe**: Works great for heel-toe action
- **With Buttkicker**: 
  - Tested without buttkicker initially (vibration motors for gear shifts)
  - Turned off to not distract from shifter feel
  - Imagines it will be even better with buttkicker adding "clunk" when engaging gear

### Value Assessment
- **Price**: €1,400-1,500 (Ireland pricing)
  - "A lot of money for a shifter" - "let's not beat about the bush"
