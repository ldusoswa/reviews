## Quick Reference
- **Review Status**: First Impressions Complete
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-24

## Product Components
- [x] Pedals (3-pedal set)
- [x] Base Plate

## Key Specifications
### Pro Pedal GT Mark I
- **Configuration**: 3-pedal set (throttle, clutch, brake)
- **Material**: Lightweight aluminum (very light construction)
- **Load Cell**: Brake pedal (capacity not specified in transcript)
- **Haptic Motors**: Vibration motors on brake pedal (add-on, retrofittable)
- **Connectivity**: USB-C (throttle is main hub)
- **Software**: Smart Drive software
- **Firmware**: Updateable via Arduino interface

#### Brake System
- **Type**: Load cell with elastomer stack and cups
- **Key Feature**: Cup system limiting elastomer compression
  - Cups only allow ~30-40% elastomer compression
  - Prevents elastomer degradation beyond 60% effectiveness
  - Extends elastomer lifespan significantly
- **Damper**: Adjustable damper with height adjustment
- **Spring**: Initial slack pickup with light spring
- **Stack Configuration**: Light → Medium → Hardest (furthest away)
- **Default Configuration**: "Remarkably accurate" - very stiff, race car feel
- **Travel**: Couple centimeters (quite a bit of travel despite feeling short)
- **Feel**: Two-phase progressive ramp (not distinct phases, smooth progression)
  - First phase: Very nice, relatively little pressure to ~50%
  - Second phase: "Where the magic is" - progressive ramp up
- **Calibration**: No calibration needed - worked perfectly out of box

#### Throttle
- **Type**: Spring-based, no linkage mechanism
- **Feel**: "Quite possibly the best throttle I've ever used in sim racing"
  - "Right up there with Sim Magic P2000"
  - "Potentially the best throttle I've ever used"
- **Modulation**: "Beautiful" - very easy to modulate
- **Control**: "A lot of control" - can hit precise percentages easily (50%, 90%)
- **Smoothness**: "Very very smooth" from first touch
- **Weight**: Long throw, nice weight, very smooth
- **Dampening**: "Little bit of dampening" - feels right
- **Electronics**: Main hub - USB connections, haptic input, clutch/brake inputs

#### Clutch
- **Type**: Simulated bite point (no adjustment for bite point position)
- **Weight**: "Very heavy" - "A lot heavier than expected"
- **Feel**: "Very like a real car clutch" - extremely realistic
- **Bite Point**: Around 70-75% travel
- **Damper**: Has damper (may contribute to heavy feel)
- **Concern**: "Disproportionately heavy compared to throttle"
  - Heavy enough to require training/adjustment
  - "Really have to beat that up" for quick shifts
- **H-Pattern Use**: Functional but requires getting used to heavy weight
- **Realism**: "Definitely becoming more natural" - feels authentic to real road car
- **Cable**: Sensor cable fastened along pedal

#### Haptic Feedback
- **Location**: Brake pedal only (not on throttle)
- **Power**: USB-powered (unclear if dedicated power supply needed)
- **Motors**: Vibration motors (retrofittable add-on)
- **Strength**: Not as powerful as Simagic or Sim3D
  - Reminiscent of original Fanatec ClubSport V1 pedals
  - "Definite feel there" but not top-tier intensity
- **Effects Tested**: ABS, gear shift, gear grinding, jump landing, traction loss, traction control, wheel lock, wheel spin
- **Performance**: "Pretty instant" feedback, works well
- **Reviewer Note**: May be comparing unfairly to Simagic (which "ruined" other haptics)
