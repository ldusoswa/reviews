## R25 Ultra Review Notes

### Key Specifications
- **Torque**: 25 Nm direct drive
- **Power Supply**: 378 watt (good form factor, smaller than R21 brick)
- **Motor Design**: New architecture (different from R16/R21)
- **USB Connection**: USB-B (not USB-C)
- **Weight**: Very heavy despite small size

### Physical Design & Build Quality
**Form Factor:**
- "Very small" - "crazy small" 
- Considerably shorter than Asetek Invicta (including shaft)
- Even smaller than La Prima
- "Beyond happy" with compact size
- Heavy despite small dimensions

**Mounting Options:**
- **Side mount holes**: "Huge huge bonus" - first time on Moza bases
- **Front mount**: First time Moza bases have front mount
- **Top mounting holes**: For dash screens (improved from original CM dash design)
- Fits nicely under screens in compact setups

**LED Features:**
- LED strips on sides (top only, not bottom like Invicta)
- LEDs not visible in reviewer's typical FOV setup (wheel deck under screens)
- Similar LED visibility issue as Asetek Invicta/Forte

**Ports & Connections:**
- USB-B (not USB-C) 
- Pedals, shifter, e-stop ports (similar to previous models)
- No USB pass-through (reviewer would love to see this)
- Bavarian Sim working on USB pass-through solution for Moza protocol

**Quick Release:**
- Compatible with Moza steering wheels
- No emergency stop button on base (unlike some competitors)
  - May indicate firmware protection/barriers preventing extreme forces

### Initial Firmware Issues (Pre-Release)
**Major Problems:**
- "Horrible time" with wheelbase initially
- Over-center issue with multiple steering wheels
- Audible knocking/play in quick release
- Issue present across three different steering wheels
- Curb effects "absolutely rotten" - had to turn down to zero
- Wife annoyed by excessive noise from vibrations
- Several weeks of firmware testing required
- Back and forth with Moza showing videos and feedback

**Firmware Development:**
- Multiple firmware updates during review period
- Issue sounded like hardware but was software-related
- When stopped in pits (heavy steering), issue didn't occur
- Reviewer delayed video release to wait for proper release firmware
- "I'm not a beta tester" - wants to review customer-ready product
- Several weeks between first test and release firmware

**Resolution:**
- Release firmware resolved most issues
- Knock mainly occurs over 0 degrees but doesn't affect driving
- Curb effects improved but still quite intense
- "Went from zero to hero" with firmware improvements

### Software & Settings
**Moza Pit House Software:**
- Automatically loads profile for each game (nice feature)
- Software improving despite initial issues
- **Criticism**: "Professional game force feedback intensity" slider goes to 200%
  - "Makes absolutely no sense" - should be 0-100% only
  - "Don't give me 100% and then an extra 100%"

**Default Profile Issues:**
- Running at only 40% by default (seemed low)
- Curb effects way too high initially (turned to zero)
- Road effects very intense
- Needed significant tuning from defaults

**Optimal Settings Discovery:**
- **Force Feedback Interpolation**: Turning this way down was KEY
  - "Should have started like this"
  - Felt "filtered" with interpolation high
  - Much more connected with interpolation low
- **Natural Friction**: Turned off
- **Natural Damping**: Experimented (35% then back down)
- **Force Feedback Intensity**: 60-80% (surprisingly high for 25 Nm base)
  - "I would never run a wheelbase that's 25 Newton meters at 80%"
  - At 80% with filters off: "This is incredible"
- **Curb Effects**: In-game curb effects turned to zero
  - Still getting lots of road vibration/undulation
  - "Almost like it's a canned effect from Mosa"
  - More rattling than preferred when not on curbs
- **Game Damping**: Was at 100% (questioned why)
- **Natural Inertia**: At 250% (questioned what this means)

**Settings Philosophy:**
- Reviewer trusts manufacturer profiles initially
- "Can't blame my settings if it doesn't feel right"
- Benchmark: Road 42, Curbs 40 (usual starting point)
- Prefers linear settings, high force feedback for lower Nm bases

### Force Feedback Performance

**Initial Impressions (With Filters):**
- Felt "slightly filtered"
- Looking for "slight bit more connection"
- Sometimes very intense vibrations, other times too smooth
- "Very smooth and then all of a sudden it gets very very rough"
- Wanted less extreme in both directions
- Easy to drive, nice to drive
- Very connected to the road
- Wheel wants to pull itself straight when exiting corners (positive)
- Not overcompensating with all that power
- Easy to modulate throttle
- Making difficult car "look quite easy" (very positive)

**After Removing Filters:**
- "Oh, this is lovely"
- "Way way more range. Way more range mid-corner"
- "This is way rawer power"
- "Actually vibrating less" (with interpolation filter off)
- "This is very enjoyable"
- "That's when we get the true measure of firmware"
- "This is incredible"
- "Genuinely feels connected"
- Hands moved from slight curb touch (excellent detail)

**Detailed Characteristics:**
- Lots of force feedback felt on straights (positive)
- Can feel the grip (main reason FF important to reviewer)
- Very connected feeling
- Straight away felt oversteer through wheel (very positive sign)
- Able to recover from mistakes easily
- Nice force feedback on weight transfer
- Could feel front left gripping up
- Vibrations "came in clutch" - very informative
- Wheel speed being high didn't cause overcompensation issues
- Hands-off protection works really nice (won't break thumbs)

**Curb & Road Effects:**
- Curb effects distinctive - "slightly different to Semagic Alpha Evo series"
- "More intense rumble" 
- Can easily tune it out
- Lots of rattling over road undulations
- More vibration than reviewer prefers when not on curbs
- "A lot of it through the wheel"
- Noise could be irritating if it matters in your environment
- Damper might help but reviewer didn't find exact setting

**Mid-Corner Feel:**
- "Racing is all about mid-corner adjustment" (reviewer philosophy)
- Felt way more in corners with filters down
- Intuitive driving feel
- Nice loading up and releasing of steering wheel
- Easy to make small adjustments
- "Feeling of intuitive driving is always what I look for"

### Performance Comparison

**Power & Strength:**
- "Big boy territory" - competing with:
  - Simucube SC2 Pro
  - Simagic Alpha U
  - VRS (even their 32 Nm)
- Running at 80% felt appropriate (unusual for 25 Nm base)
- "If I run an SC2 Pro at 80%, it's a little scarier than this"
- Not convinced it feels like SC2 Pro power levels
- Lots of protection/barriers in firmware (speculation)

**vs Other Moza Bases:**
- Replaced R16 and R21 in lineup
- R16 and R21 "already great"
- R25 "needs to be brilliant" as flagship
- Old R21 was "plenty" of power
- R16 "actually a really good base" with plenty of power
- Unsure if R25 is step up from R21 (hard to tell at high Nm)
- Possible less strength in newer architecture vs old R16/R21
- R12 maybe had less strength than Asetek La Prima

**vs Competition:**
- Curb effects give away it's Moza (distinctive signature)
- Not "exceptionally better than anything else" in its class
- "Very, very good"
- "Very, very relevant"
- "No limitations from hardware point of view"

**Is 25 Nm Needed?:**
- "In the realm of Newton meters where I struggle to tell the difference"
- Looking for "fine grain details"
- High Nm for impact forces (small rotation, immense force)
- Example: Hitting curb/stone at 200 km/h - "bang" force with tiny rotation
- "That's why you need this range"
- Suspension impacts in rally
- Not about "arms ripped off" or "arm workout"

### Testing Methodology
**Car & Track:**
- Assetto Corsa (primary test platform)
- Specific car/track combo used for all wheelbase reviews
- Car is "brutal" and "completely unforgiving"
- Track has lots of road feel (great FF indicator)
- Also tested: iRacing, Dirt Rally 2, EA WRC
- Does LMU, ACC, rally, drifting regularly

**Review Timeline:**
- Several weeks of testing
- Waited for release firmware (not beta)
- "My time is precious. Your time is precious"
- Didn't want message "living out there on the internet forever" that isn't accurate
- Would have been "disaster" if released first impressions early
- "Tremendous waste of effort" initially but glad he waited

### Final Verdict

**Strengths:**
- Compact form factor with heavy-duty performance
- Side mount AND front mount options (first for Moza)
- Small, efficient power supply
- Great mounting flexibility (Fanatec pattern compatible)
- Firmware improvements delivered excellent final result
- Connected, intuitive force feedback (with proper settings)
- Easy to drive, confidence-inspiring
- Hardware quality excellent
- "What I expected from MOSA"
- "No concerns" about recommending it

**Considerations:**
- Requires significant settings tuning (turn off filters)
- Default profiles not optimal
- Curb effects can be intense/noisy
- No emergency stop button
- Still using USB-B (not USB-C)
- No native USB pass-through (yet)
- May not feel as powerful as SC2 Pro at same percentage
- Distinctive curb effect signature

**Target Market:**
- "If you are sold on MOSA, this is a no-brainer"
- Perfect if you want to use Moza steering wheels
- Flagship Moza product
- Compact size ideal for space-limited setups

**Value Proposition:**
- "Do you need the R25 over the R21? Tough to say"
- Old R21 was "plenty" 
- R16 was "plenty" and "really good base"
- Capability of motor architecture matters
- "Is this enough power for me? Yes, 100%"

**Recommendation:**
- "Absolute no-brainer" if using Moza wheels
- "Good device" - Moza "done a great job"
- "I have no concerns" for buyers
- Not exceptionally better than competition, but very competitive
- "Very, very good" in its class

**Long-term Review Plans:**
- Will compare to SC3 when available
- Will compare to Simagic Evo Ultra when released
- Swapping back and forth between bases for comparison
- "Get my thoughts together for final review"
- Much of first impressions content will be in long-term review

- "Had a little bit of an issue installing, to be honest"
- Bolt holes at extreme four corners of very large base plate
- "Really really large base plate"
- Doesn't fit standard profile rig mounting patterns well
- **ASR Pro rig**: Required custom mounting solution
  - Used cable channel and spacers
  - Concerned about movement/travel
  - Something moved when pressing very hard
  - "Not delighted with how that mounts"
  - Never had rotation issues with P1X

**Mounting Options:**
- Can mount from bottom up (threaded holes underneath)
- Top-down mounting difficult on profile rigs
- Would work better with larger pedal plates
- P1X pedal plate mentioned as potentially better fit

**Recommendation:**
- "Pedals meant to be used with a solid rig"
- Need something you can actually mount to properly
- Profile rig users may need custom solutions

### Software & Calibration

- One-click activation system
- Device detection (had one failed attempt, then worked)
- Visual feedback for all three pedals
- Calibration wizard available

**Calibration Process:**
- 6-star calibration system
- "Press down completely, press the pedal once, then let it go"
- Sensor output graph (narrower than other graphs - "seems strange")
- Can switch between Hall effect and Load cell modes
- Load cell mode preferred by reviewer

**Sensor Mode Selection:**
- Hall effect: Angle-based (good for rally, less critical braking)
- Load cell: Force-based (more work but "far more authentic experience")
- Easy to switch between modes in software

### First Impressions - Feel & Performance

**Initial Setup (Default Configuration):**

**Clutch:**
- Better than expected from bench test
- "Fine" for sim racing
- "More than good"
- Little to nothing would change
- Not the best feeling clutch ever, but good value

**Throttle:**
- Good weight out of box
- Heavier than many competitors
- Feels appropriate with shoes
- Would be lighter feeling without shoes
- "Things are looking good"

**Brake (Default Elastomers):**
- **Major concern**: "Little bit spongy"
- "Quite a lot of travel before we get that big weight"
- Reminds of P1000 experience (not favorite)
- "Spongy feel" from rubber pucks
- "Brake feels pretty lifeless"
- "Feels like a brake system that needs bleeding"
- "Like there's air in the system"
- "Having to press quite far"
- "Feels like tracking a road car when brakes get hot"
- "Feel like I'm having to do a lot of work to find the feeling"
- "Not doing it for me"
- "Foot's going to the floor - need to upgrade my brakes feeling"

**Context Note:**
- Just came from Simtrecs pedals ("quite possibly the best pedals I've had")
- Very close to Mecca Evos
- "Ridiculously expensive set of pedals"
- Acknowledges possible adjustment period needed

### Driving Experience

**Formula Car (High Downforce):**
- "Definitely not undrivable"
- Not necessarily slower
- Lots of learning required
- "A me issue rather than a pedals issue"
- Brake feel not intuitive
- "Driving experience is just not doing it for me"
- Feels like needing better brakes (track day analogy)
- "Definitely on the fence"

**Road Car (Honda Civic, Manual):**
- Front-wheel drive, lots of gear shifting
- Heel-toe "going very nicely"
- Flat shifting successful
- "Better experience" than formula car
- Breaking expectations "slightly different" (road car context)

**Heel-Toe Specific:**
- **Issue**: Throttle positioning for heel-toe
- Pedal faces all flush (no offset)
- "Kind of hitting the side of the pedal during heel-toe"
- "Not ideal"
- When on brakes, brake pedal way beyond throttle
- "Really have to reach back" with foot for throttle blip
- "Throttle isn't where you'd like it to be"
- Would love to move throttle back or brake forward
- "Slight failing on the heel plate"
- Potentially fixable by changing pedal face angles
- But pedal face angles nice as-is

### Performance Analysis

**Brake Feel Deep Dive:**
- "Lifeless" with default elastomers
- "Spongy" - like air in brake lines
- Lots of travel before resistance
- "Slightest bit of touch should feel like it's doing something"
- Current setup doesn't provide that immediate feedback
- "Elastomer stack just isn't quite there"
- First planned adjustment: Install hardest elastomers
- Will run default for one week, then modify

**Comparison to CSL Elite V2 (€300):**
- CRP2 clutch: "Far better" than CSL Elite V2
- CRP2 throttle: "Far better" than CSL Elite V2
- **CSL Elite V2 brake**: "Definitely better" out of box
- First impression of CSL Elite V2 "a lot better than this brake"
- CSL Elite V2 costs €250 less for full 3-pedal set

**Driving Performance:**
- Not making reviewer slower
- Can drive well with them
- "You drive as well as the equipment allows you to"
- Adjustment period likely needed
- Competitive racing planned for the week

**Intuitive Feel:**
- Compares to Fanatec CSL Elite V2 initial experience

- **Side 2**: Wheelbase connection, clutch connection, power input
- Power comes in from side (could interfere with clutch placement)
- Integrated controller in pedal unit

**Mounting System:**
- Requires base plate extension for CRP2 pedals
- Extension pieces connect underneath existing CRP2 base plate
- Threaded holes run along extension plate
- Mounting holes on both left and right (supports multiple active pedals)
- "Clear intention" that multiple pedals can be used
- Can mount as brake (center/left) or throttle (right)

### Base Plate Extension & Mounting

**Extension Plate:**
- Makes already large CRP2 base plate even larger
- "Twice the size" of standard CRP2 pedal set
- Two extension pieces connect to existing base plate
- Line of threaded holes for pedal mounting
- Holes on both sides (left and right) for flexibility

**Size Concerns:**
- "Absolutely huge" base plate with extension
- Overhangs ASR Pro rig (high-end rig)
- "If you're stuck for space, that's going to be a definite concern"
- Installation base relatively small, but overall footprint massive
- Could mount pedals individually, but loses heel rest benefit

**Mounting Experience:**
- Required custom mounting solution on ASR Pro rig
- More difficult to mount than standard pedals
- "Harder to mount than the Simucube one"
- Mounting was already an issue with CRP2 pedals alone

**Base Plate Notes:**
- Original CRP2 control box becomes useless with MBooster
- Cables will stick out even with base plate (control box not integrated)
- Less elegant than integrated CRP2 solution
- Once mounted, base plate "actually pretty good"

### Software & Calibration

**Moza Pit House Software:**
- Fresh installation required
- Must run as administrator (ongoing issue)
- Sometimes doesn't run - requires ending task in Task Manager
- "Really annoying" software reliability issues
- One-click upgrade system (updates software automatically)
- One-click activation (usually simple)

**Initial Setup Issues:**
- Pedals mapped incorrectly initially
- Software version changed after restart (unclear how)
- Pedal behavior changed significantly after software update
- Felt "a lot more realistic" after proper software version loaded

**Calibration Process:**
- Motor calibration required
- "Ridiculously slow" calibration process (cut from video)
- Pedal moves automatically during calibration
- Must not disconnect during calibration

**Software Interface:**

*Main Settings:*
- Pedal feel adjustment
- Pedal travel slider
- Natural friction toggle (reviewer turned OFF)
- Natural dampening adjustment
- Force settings (up to 200kg displayed)
- Simulator input mapping (separate tab - not intuitive)

*Effects Settings:*
- Engine vibration test (didn't work for reviewer)
- ABS effects (didn't work for reviewer)
- Traction control effects (didn't work for reviewer)
- Brake threshold vibration (works - vibrates at set brake percentage)
  - "Quite like that" - useful for consistent cars
  - Can set specific threshold

**Software Usability:**
- "Not as intuitive" as expected
- Critical setting (100% input mapping) on separate tab
- "I kind of think that should be on the same screen"
- Less intuitive than Simucube software
- "Simucube software maybe is slightly more refined"
- Can use other people's profiles (Simucube advantage)
- Once figured out, can achieve desired feel

**Calibration Challenges:**
- Initially couldn't get brake to register 100%
- Had to find "Simulator input mapping" tab
- Wanted slider adjustment for easier configuration
- Force numbers unclear (130kg, 200kg - doesn't feel accurate)
- "I don't know what exactly that means" (force readings)

### Technical Issues

**Coil Whine:**
- **Major Issue**: Immediate coil whine when plugged in
- Constant noise even when PC is off
- "Noise means energy" - inefficient
- Similar to Simagic Alpha base issues
- Must unplug power block to stop whining
- "Bit of a problem"
- "I'd love if that's something they can fix"
- Wastes energy continuously

**Motor Noise:**
- "Pedals are noisy"
- "Quite a lot of noise from the motor and the pedal"
- Slight "graininess" feel (similar to Simucube)
- Similar in feel and sound to Simucube

**Software Reliability:**
- Must run as administrator
- Sometimes won't start without ending task
- Version confusion during setup
- Not as polished as Simucube software

### Feel & Performance

**Initial Impressions (Pre-Configuration):**
- Very light initially
- Slight graininess (similar to Simucube)
- Feels "very dampened" at first
- "Doesn't feel very mechanical"
- "Feels very robotic"
- Improved significantly after removing natural friction

**After Configuration:**
- "Feels like a really good brake"
- "Pretty consistent" brake point finding
- Can achieve desired feel with tuning
- "Whatever brake pedal I want" - full customization
- "Feels really good"

**Force Levels:**
- Default: Too light
- Mid-range: "Decent" - 60% travel comfortable
- High force (200kg setting): "Hell of a lot more"
- Maximum: "Definitely 90 kilos, maybe even 100 kilos"
- Force readings seem inaccurate (200kg doesn't feel like 200kg)
- "Plenty heavy" for reviewer (6 foot tall, strong legs)
- Sufficient for anyone "not training for real life scenarios"

**Precision & Control:**
- "Very precise" at higher forces
- "I love a heavier pedal because I feel like I can be more precise"
- Diminishing returns beyond certain heaviness
- Can consistently find 50% brake point
- "Already hitting apexes" on first configuration
- Trail braking: Can adjust initial 20% to be lighter
- Can set dead zone (rest foot without input)

**Driving Experience:**
- Tested with Formula Agile (reviewer's benchmark car)
- Very controllable, difficult car
- Finding lock-up threshold easy
- Consistent brake application
- "Exactly what I would have wanted"
- "Always a good sign of a good brake"
- Can adjust on-the-fly for trail braking preference

### Comparison to Simucube Active Pedal Pro

**Performance Parity:**
- "Can't really tell this apart from a Simucube brake"
- "Feels very like the Simucube active pedal"
- "I don't think I could tell the difference" in blind test
- "Not better but not worse"
- "Vastly inferior experience" expected, but "it's just not"
