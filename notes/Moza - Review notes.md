## R25 Ultra Review Notes

### Key Specifications
- **Torque**: 25 Nm direct drive
- **Power Supply**: 378 watt (good form factor, smaller than R21 brick)
- **Motor Design**: New architecture (different from R16/R21)
- **USB Connection**: USB-B (not USB-C)
- **Weight**: Very heavy despite small size

### Physical Design & Build Quality
**Form Factor:**
- "Very small" - "crazy small" 
- Considerably shorter than Asetek Invicta (including shaft)
- Even smaller than La Prima
- "Beyond happy" with compact size
- Heavy despite small dimensions

**Mounting Options:**
- **Side mount holes**: "Huge huge bonus" - first time on Moza bases
- **Front mount**: First time Moza bases have front mount
- **Top mounting holes**: For dash screens (improved from original CM dash design)
- Fits nicely under screens in compact setups

**LED Features:**
- LED strips on sides (top only, not bottom like Invicta)
- LEDs not visible in reviewer's typical FOV setup (wheel deck under screens)
- Similar LED visibility issue as Asetek Invicta/Forte

**Ports & Connections:**
- USB-B (not USB-C) 
- Pedals, shifter, e-stop ports (similar to previous models)
- No USB pass-through (reviewer would love to see this)
- Bavarian Sim working on USB pass-through solution for Moza protocol

**Quick Release:**
- Compatible with Moza steering wheels
- No emergency stop button on base (unlike some competitors)
  - May indicate firmware protection/barriers preventing extreme forces

### Initial Firmware Issues (Pre-Release)
**Major Problems:**
- "Horrible time" with wheelbase initially
- Over-center issue with multiple steering wheels
- Audible knocking/play in quick release
- Issue present across three different steering wheels
- Curb effects "absolutely rotten" - had to turn down to zero
- Wife annoyed by excessive noise from vibrations
- Several weeks of firmware testing required
- Back and forth with Moza showing videos and feedback

**Firmware Development:**
- Multiple firmware updates during review period
- Issue sounded like hardware but was software-related
- When stopped in pits (heavy steering), issue didn't occur
- Reviewer delayed video release to wait for proper release firmware
- "I'm not a beta tester" - wants to review customer-ready product
- Several weeks between first test and release firmware

**Resolution:**
- Release firmware resolved most issues
- Knock mainly occurs over 0 degrees but doesn't affect driving
- Curb effects improved but still quite intense
- "Went from zero to hero" with firmware improvements

### Software & Settings
**Moza Pit House Software:**
- Automatically loads profile for each game (nice feature)
- Software improving despite initial issues
- **Criticism**: "Professional game force feedback intensity" slider goes to 200%
  - "Makes absolutely no sense" - should be 0-100% only
  - "Don't give me 100% and then an extra 100%"

**Default Profile Issues:**
- Running at only 40% by default (seemed low)
- Curb effects way too high initially (turned to zero)
- Road effects very intense
- Needed significant tuning from defaults

**Optimal Settings Discovery:**
- **Force Feedback Interpolation**: Turning this way down was KEY
  - "Should have started like this"
  - Felt "filtered" with interpolation high
  - Much more connected with interpolation low
- **Natural Friction**: Turned off
- **Natural Damping**: Experimented (35% then back down)
- **Force Feedback Intensity**: 60-80% (surprisingly high for 25 Nm base)
  - "I would never run a wheelbase that's 25 Newton meters at 80%"
  - At 80% with filters off: "This is incredible"
- **Curb Effects**: In-game curb effects turned to zero
  - Still getting lots of road vibration/undulation
  - "Almost like it's a canned effect from Mosa"
  - More rattling than preferred when not on curbs
- **Game Damping**: Was at 100% (questioned why)
- **Natural Inertia**: At 250% (questioned what this means)

**Settings Philosophy:**
- Reviewer trusts manufacturer profiles initially
- "Can't blame my settings if it doesn't feel right"
- Benchmark: Road 42, Curbs 40 (usual starting point)
- Prefers linear settings, high force feedback for lower Nm bases

### Force Feedback Performance

**Initial Impressions (With Filters):**
- Felt "slightly filtered"
- Looking for "slight bit more connection"
- Sometimes very intense vibrations, other times too smooth
- "Very smooth and then all of a sudden it gets very very rough"
- Wanted less extreme in both directions
- Easy to drive, nice to drive
- Very connected to the road
- Wheel wants to pull itself straight when exiting corners (positive)
- Not overcompensating with all that power
- Easy to modulate throttle
- Making difficult car "look quite easy" (very positive)

**After Removing Filters:**
- "Oh, this is lovely"
- "Way way more range. Way more range mid-corner"
- "This is way rawer power"
- "Actually vibrating less" (with interpolation filter off)
- "This is very enjoyable"
- "That's when we get the true measure of firmware"
- "This is incredible"
- "Genuinely feels connected"
- Hands moved from slight curb touch (excellent detail)

**Detailed Characteristics:**
- Lots of force feedback felt on straights (positive)
- Can feel the grip (main reason FF important to reviewer)
- Very connected feeling
- Straight away felt oversteer through wheel (very positive sign)
- Able to recover from mistakes easily
- Nice force feedback on weight transfer
- Could feel front left gripping up
- Vibrations "came in clutch" - very informative
- Wheel speed being high didn't cause overcompensation issues
- Hands-off protection works really nice (won't break thumbs)

**Curb & Road Effects:**
- Curb effects distinctive - "slightly different to Semagic Alpha Evo series"
- "More intense rumble" 
- Can easily tune it out
- Lots of rattling over road undulations
- More vibration than reviewer prefers when not on curbs
- "A lot of it through the wheel"
- Noise could be irritating if it matters in your environment
- Damper might help but reviewer didn't find exact setting

**Mid-Corner Feel:**
- "Racing is all about mid-corner adjustment" (reviewer philosophy)
- Felt way more in corners with filters down
- Intuitive driving feel
- Nice loading up and releasing of steering wheel
- Easy to make small adjustments
- "Feeling of intuitive driving is always what I look for"

### Performance Comparison

**Power & Strength:**
- "Big boy territory" - competing with:
  - Simucube SC2 Pro
  - Simagic Alpha U
  - VRS (even their 32 Nm)
- Running at 80% felt appropriate (unusual for 25 Nm base)
- "If I run an SC2 Pro at 80%, it's a little scarier than this"
- Not convinced it feels like SC2 Pro power levels
- Lots of protection/barriers in firmware (speculation)

**vs Other Moza Bases:**
- Replaced R16 and R21 in lineup
- R16 and R21 "already great"
- R25 "needs to be brilliant" as flagship
- Old R21 was "plenty" of power
- R16 "actually a really good base" with plenty of power
- Unsure if R25 is step up from R21 (hard to tell at high Nm)
- Possible less strength in newer architecture vs old R16/R21
- R12 maybe had less strength than Asetek La Prima

**vs Competition:**
- Curb effects give away it's Moza (distinctive signature)
- Not "exceptionally better than anything else" in its class
- "Very, very good"
- "Very, very relevant"
- "No limitations from hardware point of view"

**Is 25 Nm Needed?:**
- "In the realm of Newton meters where I struggle to tell the difference"
- Looking for "fine grain details"
- High Nm for impact forces (small rotation, immense force)
- Example: Hitting curb/stone at 200 km/h - "bang" force with tiny rotation
- "That's why you need this range"
- Suspension impacts in rally
- Not about "arms ripped off" or "arm workout"

### Testing Methodology
**Car & Track:**
- Assetto Corsa (primary test platform)
- Specific car/track combo used for all wheelbase reviews
- Car is "brutal" and "completely unforgiving"
- Track has lots of road feel (great FF indicator)
- Also tested: iRacing, Dirt Rally 2, EA WRC
- Does LMU, ACC, rally, drifting regularly

**Review Timeline:**
- Several weeks of testing
- Waited for release firmware (not beta)
- "My time is precious. Your time is precious"
- Didn't want message "living out there on the internet forever" that isn't accurate
- Would have been "disaster" if released first impressions early
- "Tremendous waste of effort" initially but glad he waited

### Final Verdict

**Strengths:**
- Compact form factor with heavy-duty performance
- Side mount AND front mount options (first for Moza)
- Small, efficient power supply
- Great mounting flexibility (Fanatec pattern compatible)
- Firmware improvements delivered excellent final result
- Connected, intuitive force feedback (with proper settings)
- Easy to drive, confidence-inspiring
- Hardware quality excellent
- "What I expected from MOSA"
- "No concerns" about recommending it

**Considerations:**
- Requires significant settings tuning (turn off filters)
- Default profiles not optimal
- Curb effects can be intense/noisy
- No emergency stop button
- Still using USB-B (not USB-C)
- No native USB pass-through (yet)
- May not feel as powerful as SC2 Pro at same percentage
- Distinctive curb effect signature

**Target Market:**
- "If you are sold on MOSA, this is a no-brainer"
- Perfect if you want to use Moza steering wheels
- Flagship Moza product
- Compact size ideal for space-limited setups

**Value Proposition:**
- "Do you need the R25 over the R21? Tough to say"
- Old R21 was "plenty" 
- R16 was "plenty" and "really good base"
- Capability of motor architecture matters
- "Is this enough power for me? Yes, 100%"

**Recommendation:**
- "Absolute no-brainer" if using Moza wheels
- "Good device" - Moza "done a great job"
- "I have no concerns" for buyers
- Not exceptionally better than competition, but very competitive
- "Very, very good" in its class

**Long-term Review Plans:**
- Will compare to SC3 when available
- Will compare to Simagic Evo Ultra when released
- Swapping back and forth between bases for comparison
- "Get my thoughts together for final review"
- Much of first impressions content will be in long-term review
