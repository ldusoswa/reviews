### Brake Pedal System
- **Primary Mechanism**: Spring mechanism visible
- **Elastomer**: One single elastomer on brake
- **Adjustment**: Appears to be toolless adjustment (needs confirmation)
- **Two-Stage Feel**: 
  - Initial phase for trail braking (picks up slack)
  - Harder wall after initial phase
  - "Nice progression" between stages
  - Not hugely defined but effective
- **Default Setup**: "Very very promising"
- **Calibration**: 
  - Brake set very low from factory (100% at partial press)
  - Needs calibration for full travel
  - Slight drop-off at very end when pressing hard
  - 5% dead zone at bottom recommended

### Throttle Pedal
- **Weight**: "Nice" but "would probably prefer just that little bit heavier"
- **Feel**: "Pretty okay"
- **Sensitivity**: Quite sensitive, some flickering in software
- **Pedal Face**:

- **Feel**: "Fine" for general use
- **Engagement**: Good for H-pattern driving (rally, drift, circuit)

### Pedal Spacing & Heel-Toe

  - Ball bearing side must face inward for tight spacing
  - If ball bearing on outside, creates gap between pedals
  - Pedals can be right up against each other with correct orientation

  - Excellent - throttle can be positioned beyond brake
  - Easy to blip throttle when hard on brake
  - "Can just hit the throttle slightly, give it that little blip"
- **Width**: "Quite wide" pedals

- **Clutch Flickering**: "Little bit" but "nothing to worry about"

### Mounting & Installation
- **Base Plate**: NOT included (€170 separate purchase)
- **Heel Plate**: Reviewer used ASR Pro rig's built-in heel plate
  - "Very very comfy"
  - Adjustable
  - Works well without dedicated pedal base plate
- **Individual Pedals**: 
  - Pros: Excellent adjustability, perfect spacing for heel-toe
  - Cons: Need heel plate solution (rig-provided or Sim-Lab base plate)
- **Mounting Process**: 
  - T-slot nut orientation critical for spacing
  - Had to remove and reinstall to flip T-slot nuts
  - Once correct, very stable

### First Drive Experience

### Comparison to Other Pedals
- **Coming From**: 
  - Simagic P1000 (mid-range)
  - Moza CRP2 (mid-range)
  - Previously: Simtrecs (high-end)
- **vs Asetek Invicta**: "Like a well setup Invicta" (maybe saying too much)
- **vs Asetek Forte**: "Very well set up Forte pedal"
- **vs Heusinkveld Sprints**: "Similar to the Sprints" - possibly better

- **Comparison**: 
  - P1000s and CRP2s required extensive setup
  - XP1 ready to race immediately
- **Reviewer Approach**: Always tests pedals in exact factory settings first
- **Expo vs Home**: 
  - At expos: "A lot spongier" and "did not feel as nice"
  - On own rig: Significantly better
  - Possible they adjusted for reviewer (uncertain)

### Target Market & Value
